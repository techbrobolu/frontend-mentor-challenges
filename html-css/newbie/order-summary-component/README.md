### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Red Hat Display)

### What I learned

This project helped me practice creating an order summary card with interactive elements and proper visual hierarchy. Key learnings include:

- Building a structured card layout with header image and content sections
- Implementing hover states for buttons and links with smooth transitions
- Creating a plan/subscription display section with icon, text, and action link
- Working with button styling including primary and secondary button states
- Using Flexbox to align elements horizontally (icon + text + link)
- Structuring semantic HTML for e-commerce/subscription components
- Applying proper spacing and visual hierarchy for readability

### Continued development

Areas I want to continue focusing on:

- Refining button hover effects and micro-interactions
- Improving link styling and underline effects
- Mastering CSS transitions for smooth state changes
- Enhancing card component designs with shadows and depth
- Practicing clean layout structures for subscription/payment interfaces

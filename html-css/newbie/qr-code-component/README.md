## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Outfit)

### What I learned

This project helped me practice creating a simple, centered card component. Key learnings include:

- Centering elements using Flexbox for both vertical and horizontal alignment
- Creating clean, minimal card designs with proper spacing and shadows
- Working with border-radius for rounded corners
- Implementing responsive images that scale properly
- Structuring semantic HTML for a simple component
- Using CSS custom properties for consistent styling

### Continued development

Areas I want to continue focusing on:

- Exploring more advanced centering techniques with CSS Grid
- Refining card component designs with subtle shadows and transitions
- Improving responsive design for various screen sizes
- Practicing clean, maintainable CSS structure
- Potentially adding JavaScript functionality to generate QR codes dynamically

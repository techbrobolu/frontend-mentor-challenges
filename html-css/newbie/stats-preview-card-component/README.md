### What I learned

This project helped me practice creating a responsive stats card with an image overlay effect. Key learnings include:

- Implementing CSS Grid for a two-column card layout that adapts to mobile
- Creating color overlay effects using CSS backdrop-filter
- Working with multiple font families for typography hierarchy
- Building a responsive statistics section with proper spacing
- Structuring content that switches from horizontal to vertical layout on mobile

### Continued development

Areas I want to continue focusing on:

- Mastering CSS Grid for complex responsive layouts
- Refining image overlay and blend mode techniques
- Improving responsive design patterns for card components
- Enhancing accessibility for statistical data presentation

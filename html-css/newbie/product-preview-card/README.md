## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive images with `<picture>` element
- Google Fonts (Montserrat & Fraunces)

### What I learned

This project helped me practice creating a responsive product card with different images for mobile and desktop. Key learnings include:

- Using the `<picture>` element with `<source>` to serve different images based on screen size
- Building a two-column card layout that stacks on mobile using CSS Grid or Flexbox
- Implementing price displays with strikethrough styling for original prices
- Creating hover and focus states for the "Add to Cart" button
- Working with multiple font families for visual hierarchy (Montserrat for body, Fraunces for headings)
- Structuring product information semantically for e-commerce components
- Handling responsive typography that adapts to different screen sizes

### Continued development

Areas I want to continue focusing on:

- Mastering the `<picture>` element for art direction and performance optimization
- Refining responsive grid/flexbox layouts for product cards
- Enhancing button interactions with smooth transitions and animations
- Improving accessibility for e-commerce components
- Practicing effective use of multiple font families in design

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Poppins)

### What I learned

This project helped me practice creating a complex card layout with an asymmetric grid design. Key learnings include:

- Building a unique four-card layout where cards are positioned at different vertical alignments
- Using CSS Grid to create the distinctive layout (one card on the left, two stacked in the center, one on the right)
- Implementing colored top borders to distinguish different features
- Creating responsive card designs that stack vertically on mobile and form the asymmetric layout on desktop
- Structuring a header section with different font weights for visual hierarchy
- Working with box shadows to add depth to card components
- Positioning decorative icons within cards using Flexbox or absolute positioning

### Continued development

Areas I want to continue focusing on:

- Mastering CSS Grid for complex asymmetric layouts
- Refining responsive breakpoints for smooth transitions between layouts
- Improving card design patterns with borders, shadows, and spacing
- Enhancing grid-based designs that combine both centered and offset elements
- Practicing layouts that use vertical alignment creatively

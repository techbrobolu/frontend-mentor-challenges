## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Hanken Grotesk)

### What I learned

This project helped me practice creating a dual-panel results component with gradient backgrounds and score visualization. Key learnings include:

- Creating circular score displays with proper centering techniques
- Working with gradient backgrounds and color transitions
- Building a two-column layout that adapts responsively to mobile
- Implementing hover states for interactive elements
- Structuring summary lists with category icons and scores
- Using semantic HTML for accessibility (sections, headings)

### Continued development

Areas I want to continue focusing on:

- Working with JSON data to dynamically populate content using JavaScript
- Enhancing CSS gradient techniques for visual appeal
- Improving responsive layouts for split-screen designs
- Refining button hover effects and transitions
- Building more complex score visualization components

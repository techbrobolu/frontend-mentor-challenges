## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I used flexbox styling for the first time and enjoyed seeing each elements fall into place in the layout

### Continued development

Later on, i might turn it into an actual project or use it in a side project by using javascript to generate the qr-code image.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped me whenever i wasn't sure about what a CSS property could do. I'm sure this is a website i'd be visiting regularly during my development journey.

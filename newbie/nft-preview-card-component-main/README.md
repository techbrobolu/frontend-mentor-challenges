## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Outfit)

### What I learned

This project helped me practice creating an NFT preview card with an image overlay hover effect. Key learnings include:

- Creating image overlay effects on hover with a cyan color overlay and eye icon
- Using absolute positioning to layer the overlay on top of the image
- Implementing smooth transitions for hover states
- Building a card component with NFT metadata (price, time remaining)
- Structuring information with icons for Ethereum value and time left
- Creating hover states for links (NFT title and creator name)
- Working with a dark theme design with proper contrast
- Using Flexbox for aligning metadata elements horizontally

### Continued development

Areas I want to continue focusing on:

- Mastering image overlay techniques and hover effects
- Improving transitions and micro-interactions for better UX
- Refining dark-themed designs with proper color contrast
- Enhancing accessibility for interactive card components
- Practicing icon integration and alignment in layouts

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Kumbh Sans)

### What I learned

This project helped me practice creating a profile card component with background patterns and circular avatar images. Key learnings include:

- Positioning background pattern images using CSS
- Creating circular profile images with border and proper positioning
- Building a multi-section card layout with header and body sections
- Implementing a statistics section with equal-width columns using Flexbox
- Overlapping elements (positioning the avatar over the header background)
- Working with multiple background images for decorative patterns
- Structuring semantic HTML for user profile information

### Continued development

Areas I want to continue focusing on:

- Mastering CSS positioning for complex overlapping layouts
- Refining background image positioning and sizing techniques
- Improving responsive design for card components
- Enhancing visual hierarchy in profile displays
- Practicing clean separation between structural and decorative elements
